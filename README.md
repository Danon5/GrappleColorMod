# GrappleColorMod
*A customizable grapple color mod for the game Speedrunners.*

* Supports realtime (in-game) config editing for certain features. Remember to save your changes to the config.txt.

* Supports any input RGB color, or increments through HSV hue based on grapple inputs (rainbow_grapple setting).

* Supports grapple size (width) editing.

* Supports ping anonymizing (hides or shows all mentions of ping).

* All downloaded files go in the game's main directory (replace your SpeedRunners.exe with the one from this download).

* Read the ModAssemblyReadMe file for documentation on the very primitive settings.

* To uninstall, just remove all related files and then verify integrity of game files. (If you have other modifications, don't forget to make a backup of your modified sub-content folders first.

* *Note: this changes the grapple color of all players, client-side of course. If your game is crashing, you might have altered the configuration file in an unintended way. The syntax is very precise.*
