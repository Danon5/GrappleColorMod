# GrappleColorMod
A customizable grapple color mod for the game Speedrunners.

All downloaded files go in the game's main directory (replace your SpeedRunners.exe with the one from this download).

Read the ModAssemblyReadMe file for documentation on the very primitive settings.

Supports realtime (in-game) config editing. Remember to save your changes to the config.txt.
